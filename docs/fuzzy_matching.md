# Enhanced Fuzzy Matching and Publisher Identification

This documentation covers the improvements made to the MusicBrainz database integration for more robust matching of artist names, song titles, and better identification of publishers.

## Fuzzy Matching Improvements

### Name Normalization and Similarity

We've implemented advanced fuzzy matching to handle common variations in artist names and track titles. The improvements include:

1. **Name Normalization** - A preprocessing step that standardizes names by:
   - Converting to lowercase
   - Removing punctuation (quotes, commas, etc.)
   - Stripping excess whitespace
   - Handling special characters

2. **Similarity Calculation** - A more robust similarity scoring using:
   - Exact matching (after normalization)
   - Substring matching (one name contained in the other)
   - Sequence matching ratio (for other variations)

This allows matches like "Nat King Cole" and "Nat 'King' Cole" to be treated as identical, improving our hit rate for metadata-based identification.

### Query Enhancements

The search queries have been enhanced to:

1. Generate multiple variations of names and titles, including:
   - Original version
   - Version with quotes removed
   - Version with quotes added around the string
   - Exact matching version

2. Use SQL queries that consider these variations with broader LIKE patterns

3. Calculate confidence scores based on title, artist, and release similarity

## Publisher Identification

The publisher identification functionality has been significantly improved to address the previous NULL results:

### Label Type Recognition

We now correctly identify publishers by checking:

1. The relationship type between label and work (e.g., "publisher", "publishing company")
2. The label_type ID in the MusicBrainz database (specific types are typically used for publishers)

Common label_type IDs for publishers include: 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 in the MusicBrainz database schema.

### Fallback Mechanisms

Multiple fallback mechanisms have been implemented:

1. First attempt: Direct work-label relationships with publisher relationship types
2. Second attempt: Labels with publisher label types linked to the work
3. Third attempt: Looking for publishers that have published other works by the same artist

## Code Organization

The improved code has been organized into modular components:

1. **name_matching.py** - Utilities for name normalization and similarity calculation
2. **musicbrainz_db_search.py** - Enhanced search functionality
3. **musicbrainz_db_publishers.py** - Specialized publisher identification
4. **musicbrainz_db_part2.py and musicbrainz_db_part3.py** - Helper functions
5. **musicbrainz_db.py** - Main client that integrates all components

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize client
client = MusicBrainzDatabaseClient(db_connection_string)

# Search with fuzzy matching
recordings = client.search_recording_advanced("Unforgettable", "Nat King Cole")

# Get songwriter credits with improved publisher identification
credits = client.get_credits_by_title_artist("Unforgettable", "Nat King Cole")

# The credits will now include both songwriters and publishers
for credit in credits:
    if credit['role'] == 'publisher':
        print(f"Publisher: {credit['name']}, confidence: {credit['confidence_score']}")
    else:
        print(f"{credit['role'].capitalize()}: {credit['name']}")
```

## Test Coverage

Comprehensive tests have been added to verify the improved functionality:

1. **TestNameMatching** - Verifies name normalization and similarity calculation
2. **TestPublisherIdentification** - Tests publisher detection logic
3. **TestSearchMatching** - Ensures matching scores are calculated correctly
4. **TestClientIntegration** - Integration tests for the client class

Run tests with:
```
python -m unittest tests/test_musicbrainz_db.py
```
